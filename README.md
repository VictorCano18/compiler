This repository is a compiler project using Python. <br/>
We can find a pdf file called Documento.pdf that is manual (written in spanish) about how to use the different files to run the compiler.<br/>
Also, we can find some explanations about the entire code and responses, and last but not least, all the diagrams that I followed to make this.
